00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,028
Adaptation is a profound process.

2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:05,678
Mean, you

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,258
figure out how to thrive in the world.

4
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:16,206
Yeah. But it's easier for plants. I mean,

5
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:18,627
they have no memory,

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,007
you know, they just move on to whatever's next

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,927
with a person. Now,

8
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:28,037
adapting is almost shameful.

9
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:28,548
It's like

10
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:30,427
running away.
